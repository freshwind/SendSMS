# sendSMS

This project builds an android app that can easily group reply greeting SMS on Chinese New Year. It can automatically select a group of candidate receivers who sends you a greeting message in a week.

How to contribute to this project:
1. This project is built with Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2. Currently the layout files(SendSMS/app/src/main/res/layout) need to be refined.
3. Please help test the app. Report bugs and suggestions.
4. There are some TODOs in the java files. I'll handle them one-by-one. (View->Tool Windows->TODO in Android Studio to view the TODOs).
